# Blazium Engine
## Fork of Godot Engine

The Focuses of this Engine is to create a place for devleopers to enjoy themselves, but also to focus on QoL, Community Enhancements, and Tooling for the community.

We are going to focus on expanding the Engines Networking, 2D/3D Functionalities, and MR/AR/XR/VR feature sets to allow for a more focualized approach on key aspects such as scaling for users, scaling for data mangement.

More TCP/UDP Stack control, packet control, and expanding the GDScripting Language extensively to include opening up functionality to GDScript that has been otherwise hidden.

One of the main issues with the Godot project is that it wants to be a community driven project, but it has a top down organizational structure.

Rather than being democratic, the Godot project has out of touch people who don't have skin in the game make all the decisions behind closed doors.

To solve this issue, the Blazium project needs to be open and have decisions made by the community in a public way.

People should gain more trust and say based on how much work they put into the project, because then the ones with the most authority are the ones with the most skin in the game and the most committment.


Thank you for your time,
Blazium Engine Contributors

P.S. From Bioblaze Payne

All Idologies, Political Viewpoints, and Self-Expression is allowed in the Community we ask you to be civil.
We want everyone to beable to have open discussions, and debates on various topics without the need to fear for reprocussions in their beliefs.
While we strive to accept all things, we reserve the right to keep key things off topic.
We also reserve the right, to remove those from the community that go beyond the socital norms and disrupt the equilibrium we want to foster in the community.

Everyone has a right to Make Games, and enjoy the community of those who do, and we should all take into account that we are only human, we are not perfect.

But we can all be civil and enjoy ourselves while existing together.
