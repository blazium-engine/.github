# [Blazium Engine](https://blazium.app/)

## Goals

The goals of the Blazium Engine are the follwing:

1. **0$/No donations**
2. **Merging** high priority PR's from Godot that go unaddressed for actual years.
3. **Services** needed to make games, such as lobby service, leaderboards service, etc.
4. **Platform** integration modules to help integrate and deploy your game with discord, steam, etc.
5. **Console** integration modules to help ship on switch, xbox, etc.

## A fork of [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)

The idea behind Blazium Engine is to provide quality of life improvements, optimizations, additional tooling, and other enhancements. Changes will be driven by the community, not by corporate funding. The surrounding community aims to provide a place where developers can get support, make suggestions, and interact without feeling as if they are walking on eggshells.

One of the main issues with the Godot project is that, while it started as a community driven project, its top down organizational structure has pushed community contributions into a back seat position. There is clearly still interest from the community, as shown by thousands of open pull requests and even more open issues.

The Blazium project aims to address this with a transparent, open process for improving the engine. While our community is still new, we have a plan. Trust should be built through actions, with authority placed in those that have skin in the game and contribute to the project.

While there are many things to improve, of particular interest is networking, 2D/3D functionality, scripting language capabilities, and MR/AR/XR/VR feature sets. Greater control over the TCP/UDP stack and packets would allow more complex multiplayer without developers needing to implement their own networking system. Improving GDScript will expose functionality that is otherwise inaccessible, while also bringing frequently requested features such as structs and interfaces. C# can be improved with things such as export support on interfaces, and engine interop optimizations.

Thank you for your time,

P.S. From Bioblaze Payne

All ideologies, political viewpoints, and self-expression is allowed in the community so long as you remain civil. We want open discussions and civil debates, without anyone having a fear of repercussions over their beliefs. While striving to accept most things, going egregiously off topic or beyond societal norms to disrupt and disgust is not one of those things.

Everyone has a right to make games, and should be able to enjoy a community of others with a similar goal. Remember, we are only human. None of us are perfect, but we can strive to be civil and enjoy ourselves in a shared space.
