Blazium is a fork of the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), a free and open-source
game engine designed for both 2D and 3D applications.

### Goals of the Project
- **No Donations Policy:** Operate without accepting any form of donations.
- **Merging Priority PRs:** Address high-priority pull requests from Godot that have been left unaddressed for extended periods.
- **Game Services:** Provide essential services for game development, such as lobbies, leaderboards, and more.
- **Game Development:** Implement games to test engine and services functionality.
- **Platform Integration:** Develop modules to integrate and deploy games on platforms like Discord, Steam, and others.
- **Console Integration:** Create modules to support shipping games on consoles such as Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and more.
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Ensure full portability of projects when transitioning from Godot to Blazium by maintaining GDExtension compatibility.

### Testing by Developing Games

We chose the path of developing games in order to test the engine and the services integration. Our approach is that if we make something, it will most likely be something we need or the community needs. So far with our first game, Hangman, we needed a Lobby Service, deployment to Discord, and more.

### Tools and Services

One important part of Blazium is something that isn't even in the Engine. The tools and services with which we develop multiplayer games and deploy them to different platforms. Whether it's to just validate a use case, or create completely new functionality, we will do it in order to make our games a reality. From turn based board games to realtime games, we will do it all.
