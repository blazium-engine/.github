Blazium is a fork of the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), a free and open-source
game engine designed for both 2D and 3D applications.

### Goals of the Project
- **No Donations Policy:** Operate without accepting any form of donations.
- **Merging Priority PRs:** Address high-priority pull requests from Godot that have been left unaddressed for extended periods.
- **Game Services:** Provide essential services for game development, such as lobbies, leaderboards, and more.
- **Game Development:** Implement games to test engine and services functionality.
- **Platform Integration:** Develop modules to integrate and deploy games on platforms like Discord, Steam, and others.
- **Console Integration:** Create modules to support shipping games on consoles such as Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and more.
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Ensure full portability of projects when transitioning from Godot to Blazium by maintaining GDExtension compatibility.

### Testing by Developing Games

Developing games is an excellent way to test and validate an engine, tooling, and integration with services.
We fix any issues we encounter and add features that are missing, making the experience for developers and users alike better.
With Hangman, our first small game, we added Discord export support, created a lobby service and its engine integration, and fixed a compatibility issue with Safari on iOS among many other things.

### Tools and Services

An important aspect of Blazium is the tools and services we are developing for our multiplayer games.
As we develop more multiplayer games, the types of services we offer, and their capabilities, become more significant.
From turn based to real-time, we intend to support it all.

> All ideologies, political viewpoints, and self-expression is allowed in the community so long as you remain civil.
> We want open discussions and civil debates, without anyone having a fear of repercussions over their beliefs.
> While striving to accept most things, going egregiously off topic or beyond societal norms to disrupt and disgust is not one of those things.

> Everyone has a right to make games, and should be able to enjoy a community of others with a similar goal.
> Remember, we are only human. None of us are perfect, but we can strive to be civil and enjoy ourselves in a shared space.
