Blazium is a fork of the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), a free and open-source
game engine designed for both 2D and 3D applications.

Blazium aims to remain free, open-source, and easy to use while introducing quality-of-life
improvements, optimizations, additional tools, and other enhancements missing from Godot.
These changes will be driven by the community rather than corporate funding.
The surrounding community aims to create a space where developers can receive support,
share suggestions, and interact freely without feeling as though they are walking on eggshells.

### Overarching Goals of the Project
- **No Donations Policy:** Operate without accepting any form of donations.
- **Timely Resolution of Priority PRs:** Address high-priority pull requests from Godot that have been left unaddressed for extended periods.
- **Game Development Services:** Provide essential services for game development, such as lobbies, leaderboards, and more.
- **Platform Integration Modules:** Develop modules to integrate and deploy games on platforms like Discord, Steam, and others.
- **Console Integration Modules:** Create modules to support shipping games on consoles such as Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and more.
- **GDExtension Compatibility:** Ensure full portability of projects when transitioning from Godot to Blazium by maintaining GDExtension compatibility.

### A fork of the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)

One of the main issues with the Godot project is that, while it started as a community-driven initiative, its top-down organizational
structure has sidelined community contributions, leading many developers to feel pushed away. Despite this, the continued interest from the
community is evident in the large number of open pull requests and unresolved issues.

Blazium seeks to address these issues with a transparent, open process for improving the engine.
While our community is still in its early stages, we are committed to building trust through actions.
Authority within the project will be earned by those who actively contribute and have a vested interest in its success.

> All ideologies, political viewpoints, and self-expression is allowed in the community so long as you remain civil.
> We want open discussions and civil debates, without anyone having a fear of repercussions over their beliefs.
> While striving to accept most things, going egregiously off topic or beyond societal norms to disrupt and disgust is not one of those things.

> Everyone has a right to make games, and should be able to enjoy a community of others with a similar goal.
> Remember, we are only human. None of us are perfect, but we can strive to be civil and enjoy ourselves in a shared space.
